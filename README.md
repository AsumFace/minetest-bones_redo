## old surrealist poetry

Its combination of instant and eternal action ensures that DEATH is absolutely harmless to man or mammals.

DEATH DOES NOT STAIN

*DIRECTIONS*

Remove the self-preserving seal, hold DEATH vertically, value upwards, and apply by pressing the stopper.

For heart complaints: Use DEATH centre-stage. A few seconds only is sufficient.

For gambling debts, dishonour, tedium vitae etc.: Apply DEATH liberally around the edges of the room, near skirting-boards, in cracks in the floor, in any dark cranny. Repeat every four to five hours.

For mystical ecstasy: Use DEATH having placed yourself approximately one meter from clothing, curtains, carpets.

DEATH can be used in wardropes and wall-cupboards. Shut them immediately after each application.

DEATH is recommened in Spring, from April onwards.

DEATH IS GOOD FOR YOU. NON-TOXIC.
